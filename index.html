        <ul>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways of styling a webpage: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
